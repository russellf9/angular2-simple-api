# angular2-simple-api

A very simple Angular 2 app using an API

The idea is to create a very basic application using what I've learnt from the Ng-Book2.

I'll build all from scratch rather than using a seed project.


## Usage

Run

`$ git clone https://github.com/russellf9/angular2-simple-api.git`

`$ npm install`

I'm investigating how best to serve the application, have both `live-server` and `lite-server` installed.

To run live-server

`npm run go`

To run lite-server

`npm start`

The live-server was a little flaky, so I'll see which is better.
